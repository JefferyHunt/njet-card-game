# 🤖 Claude Context - Njet Game Development

This document provides complete context for Claude to understand the Njet game project when starting a new session.

## 📋 Project Summary

**Project Name**: Njet - Strategic Card Game Implementation
**Original Designer**: Stefan Dorra (1997)
**Current Status**: Complete BGA implementation + Local development environment
**Languages**: Python (original), PHP/MySQL/HTML/CSS/JS (BGA version)

## 🎮 Game Overview

**Njet** is a sophisticated trick-taking card game with unique blocking mechanics:

### Core Mechanics
- **Blocking Phase**: Players eliminate game options using colored tokens
- **Team Formation**: Temporary partnerships that change each round
- **Trick Taking**: Follow suit with trump override and super trump (0-value cards)
- **Complex Scoring**: Team-based with captured opponent zeros bonus

### Game Components
- **4 Suits**: Red (♦), Blue (♠), Yellow (♣), Green (♥)  
- **Card Values**: 0-9 (3 copies per suit per value)
- **Player Count**: 2-5 players
- **Blocking Categories**: Start Player, Discard Rules, Trump Suit, Super Trump, Points per Trick

## 🎯 Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema (dbmodel.sql)
```sql
-- Key Tables:
cards                    # Card deck and player hands
blocking_board          # Blocking phase state and player colors  
teams                   # Team assignments per round
tricks                  # Trick-taking game state
game_parameters         # Final blocked options (trump, points, etc.)
player_statistics       # Comprehensive player stats
game_statistics         # Overall game metrics
captured_zeros          # Bonus scoring for captured opponent zeros
```

### PHP Game Logic (njet.game.php)
```php
// Key Classes & Methods:
class NjetGame extends Table
    - setupNewGame()           # Initialize deck, deal cards
    - stGameSetup()           # Game state initialization  
    - argBlockingPhase()      # Blocking phase arguments
    - blockOption()           # Process blocking actions
    - stNextBlockingPlayer()  # Advance blocking turns
    - calculateFinalTeams()   # Determine team assignments
    - argTrickTaking()        # Trick-taking arguments  
    - playCard()              # Process card plays

## 🔑 Key Concepts for Claude

### Game-Specific Logic
- **Blocking Validation**: Each category must have exactly 1 option remaining
- **Team Formation**: Starting player selects teammates (1 for 4p, 2 for 5p)  
- **Super Trump**: 0-value cards beat everything (last played wins)
- **Captured Zeros**: Bonus points for taking opponent team's 0s
- **Monster Card**: Doubles team score in 3/5 player games

### Technical Patterns
- **BGA Framework**: Uses Table class, state machine, notifications system
- **Database Pattern**: Normalized schema with efficient queries
- **UI Pattern**: Phase-based interface with smooth transitions
- **Animation System**: CSS transforms with JavaScript coordination
- **Color System**: Player colors for blocking phase tracking

### Development Workflow
- **Local Development**: Docker environment for rapid testing
- **File Structure**: Standard BGA Studio organization
- **Database**: MySQL with proper indexing and constraints
- **Frontend**: Dojo framework with custom CSS animations
- **Testing**: Automated scripts for validation

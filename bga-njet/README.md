# Njet - Professional Board Game Arena Implementation

A complete, production-ready implementation of Stefan Dorra's strategic card game **Njet** for Board Game Arena, featuring professional-grade custom artwork, animations, and user experience.

## üéÆ Game Overview

**Njet** is a sophisticated trick-taking game where players use blocking tokens to eliminate game options before forming temporary partnerships and competing for tricks. The game combines strategic blocking, team formation, and tactical card play in a unique two-phase gameplay system.

### Key Features

- **Strategic Blocking Phase**: Players eliminate options for trump suits, starting players, discard rules, and point values
- **Dynamic Team Formation**: Temporary partnerships that change each round
- **Complex Trump System**: Regular trump and super trump (0-value cards) mechanics
- **Professional UI**: Custom artwork, smooth animations, and responsive design
- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Full BGA Studio integration with live updates

## üéØ Game Rules Implementation

### Blocking Phase
- Players take turns blocking options from 5 categories
- Each category must have exactly 1 option remaining
- Player colors track who blocked each option
- Smart validation prevents invalid blocks

### Team Formation
- Starting player selects teammates based on player count
- 3 players: 1 teammate (2v1)
- 4 players: 1 teammate (2v2)
- 5 players: 2 teammates (3v2)

### Trick Taking
- Follow suit rules with trump override
- Super trump 0s beat everything (last played wins)
- Captured opponent 0s provide bonus points
- Monster card doubles team score (3/5 player games)

### Scoring System
- Team score = (tricks won + captured opponent 0s) √ó points per trick
- Monster card holder's team score is doubled
- Individual scores accumulate across rounds
- Comprehensive statistics tracking

## üìä Statistics Tracked
